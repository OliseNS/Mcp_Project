### Components

- **Input Handler**: FastAPI server with healthcare-specific endpoints
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB for medical document storage and semantic search
- **Agent**: HealthcareAgent orchestrates medical workflows
- **LLM**: OpenRouter integration for access to multiple AI models
- **Output**: Healthcare responses with medical disclaimers

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenRouter API Key
- Docker (optional)

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Mcp_Project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
CHROMA_DB_PATH=./healthcare_db
MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4
TEMPERATURE=0.3
MAX_TOKENS=1500
HEALTHCARE_COLLECTION=healthcare_knowledge
MEDICAL_DISCLAIMER=This AI assistant provides general health information only and should not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
```

### 4. Start the Server

#### Option A: Direct Python
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Option B: Module
```bash
python -m mcp_server.api
```

### 5. Launch Healthcare Interface

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## üöÄ Deployment on Railway

1. **Set environment variables**: Ensure you have a `.env` file with your OpenRouter API key and any other required settings (see `mcp_server/config.py`).

2. **Deploy**: Push your repository to Railway.

3. **Service settings**:
   - Set the start command to `python main.py`.
   - Set the service port to `8000`.

4. **Access**: Once deployed, your MCP server will be available at `https://<your-railway-app>.railway.app/` and will respond to health checks at `/health`.

**Note:** Streamlit is no longer included or required for this deployment.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Run in background
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t healthcare-mcp-server .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env healthcare-mcp-server
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenRouter API Key Error**
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Check that the API key has sufficient credits
   - Verify the model name is correct (e.g., `openai/gpt-4`)

2. **ChromaDB Connection Error**
   - Ensure the `healthcare_db` directory exists and is writable
   - Check file permissions

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `.env` file
   - Kill existing processes using the port

4. **Docker Issues**
   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
   - Check that ports 8000 and 8501 are available

### Logs

```bash
# View Docker logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f mcp-server
docker-compose logs -f streamlit
```
